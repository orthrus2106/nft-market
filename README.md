# NFT Marketplace
 This is layout project I made while learning HTML and CSS. The main goal was to practice building a clean and responsive page.

 ## What did I use

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Flex/Grid
- CSS Animations
- Gulp (Building, minification, autoprefixer)

## Goal of project
- Building a modular structure
- Practice SCSS variables and mixins
- Use flex and grid for layout
- Create a responsive design for tablets and mobile devices (from 320px)
- Add basic JavaScript for minimal interactivity
